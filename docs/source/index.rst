Welcome to memex-viewer's documentation.
========================================

The goal of the memex-viewer project is to provide users with an easy-to-use, fully-featured web interface to use for gathering, analyzing, and graphing web crawl data. With memex-viewer you can register data URIs that contain your data to be monitored. You can also add plots using the data from your data URIs. In future versions, all of this graphing and streaming data capabilities will be available to you in an easy-to-use, customizable dashboard interface. 

To get started, read our `user's guide <user_guide.html>`_. For more in-depth information about the project, refer to our `developer's guide <dev_guide.html>`_ and our `API guide <api.html>`_.

memex-viewer is built by `Continuum Analytics <http://continuum.io/>`_, with grants and support from the `NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory <http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/>`_, `Kitware <http://www.kitware.com/>`_, and the `NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering <http://engineering.nyu.edu/>`_
